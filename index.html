        <h2>The Beginning</h2>
        <p>The Apple I was the result of the development efforts of Steve Wozniak, Steve Jobs, and Ron Wayne. It was developed in the bedroom of Steve Wozniak's home. Steve Wozniak built the printed circuit-board, while Ron Wayne wrote the Apple-1 Operation Manual. Steve Jobs did what he does best, advertising the Apple I to friends and family.</p>
        <p>They first previewed the Apple I in action during a May 1976 meeting of the Homebrew Computer Club. Paul Terell, the owner of the Byte Shop was impressed by what he saw and promised to buy 50 fully assembled computers for $500 each.</p>

        <p>The Apple I was Apple's first product, and to finance its creation, Jobs sold his only motorized means of transportation for a few hundred dollars.</p>

        <p>When Apple was incorporated on April 2, 1976, Ron Wayne was named alongside Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak as one of three founders, with a 10 percent stake in the company. Wayne left the company shortly after Apple delivered their first order, just 12 days after Apple started up — feeling out of his depth because he “was standing in the shadow of intellectual giants”.</p>
        <p>Another reason behind this was because Jobs planned to go highly in debt to build large quantities of the Apple I. Having lost a lot of money in other investments with new computer companies, he wrote a letter of resignation to Apple and gave back his 10% in Apple stock. He sold his shares for just $800.</p>
